## abstract

Most people think WebAssembly is only for the Web. Yes, WebAssembly has huge implications for the web, but also to your career as developer — it provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web, as client-side and server-side applications at near native speed. 

Not many people know, yet, that you can use WebAssembly to unify programming languages. Thanks to some recent advancements in the .NET community it's now possible to take existing software, compile it to WebAssembly and convert it into a .NET assembly that runs under .NET Core. 

In this session REDACTED will share with you everything you need to know and, for your viewing pleasure, port SQLite (C9X) 

to WebAssembly and concert it into a .NET assembly that is fully interoperable with "regular" SQLite builds that can read and write SQLite database files. No existing knowledge of WebAssembly or .NET is required.
